            <p class="break-p">Each challenge page has an online editor embedded in the page for you to write and test
                your code in. If you're more comfortable coding in your favorite IDE, you can always upload your code to
                the challenge page when you're done!</p>

            <p class="break-p">When you finish the first version of your code, click Run Code button to run your
                solution against one or more small sample test cases. Once you're confident your solution covers the
                entire problem, click Submit to run it against the entire set of test cases (or bots) and get a score
                for the challenge. Don't worry if you don't pass all the test cases, you can always rework your code and
                submit it again for an updated score. The score that shows up on the leaderboard will be the one for
                your top-scoring submission.</p>

            <h4 class="FAQ">What happens after I submit my code?</h4>
            <p class="break-p">We run your code against hidden test cases. Depending on the output your code produced,
                you can get the following verdicts:</p>

            <ul class="break-p">
                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accepted.</span> Congratulations, your code passed all the test
                    cases! It's time to solve a new challenge!
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wrong Answer.</span> The output your code produced didn't match the
                    output expected by the test case. Rethink your approach and think about whether you misunderstood
                    the problem or missed a corner case.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Terminated due to timeout.</span> Your code doesn't solve the
                    problem efficiently enough! If you write a O(2n) solution when n = 100, it will surely time out and
                    you're going to need to optimize your algorithm. The time limits are different for each language
                    (some languages are slower than others), and you can see the limits for all the languages we support
                    at our Environment page
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Runtime error/Segmentation Fault.</span> Your code terminated
                    unexpectedly. Did you overrun your array? Is your code trying to divide by zero?
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abort Called.</span> Are you using too many resources? Maybe an
                    array you created is too large and exceeds the memory limit, or an assert statement in your code is
                    failing.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="break-p">After you submit your code, hover your mouse cursor over the icon for each test case to
                view the verdicts and runtime for each test case your code was tested against</p>

            <h4 class="FAQ">Can I share my code or solution?</h4>
            <p class="break-p">Don't share hints/codes/strategy during a live contest — it violates the contest rules.
                It's always nice to help a fellow programmer learn, but posting spoilers during a competition makes it
                unfair. Once the contest ends, feel free to compare solutions with other coders and help others learn
                how it's done!</p>

            <h4 class="FAQ" style=" inline-size: 26rem; overflow-wrap: break-word ; margin: auto;">I don't understand the problem
                statement, what should I do?</h4>
            <p class="break-p">Read the statement a few more times, and check the Discussions tab to see if another
                coder posted something that will help you. If you still find it confusing, ask for help! If there's
                something in the problem statement you find misleading and think could be improved, submit feedback
                about the challenge and mention the specific sections you find confusing. Comments like "The challenge
                is confusing!" don't communicate enough information for people to know what you're talking about, so
                it's always best to be courteous and specific (e.g., "The second paragraph confuses me; is the graph
                directed or undirected?") when asking for help.</p>
