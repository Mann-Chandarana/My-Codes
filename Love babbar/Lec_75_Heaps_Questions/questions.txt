    - Create an array arr[] of size n, where n is the number of nodes in the given BST.
    - Perform the inorder traversal of the BST and copy the node values in the arr[] in sorted order.
    - Now perform the preorder traversal of the tree.
    - While traversing the root during the preorder traversal, one by one copy the values from the array arr[] to the nodes.
